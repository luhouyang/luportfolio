              Conducted a Flutter and Firebase full-stack workshop at UTP,
              teaching students to build cross-platform applications. Final-year
              students applied the concepts learned to their projects,
              highlighting the practical impact of the workshop. The session
              covered essential development skills and fostered hands-on
