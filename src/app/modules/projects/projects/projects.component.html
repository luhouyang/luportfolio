          Google Classroom started to share workshop materials to all UTP
          students and other interested people. With hands-on tutorians and full
          explainations on latest technologies such as TensorFlow, Flutter,
          Firebase, GitHub and more. The materials are maintained by me and my
          friends as a side project and initiative to raise technicality level
          of students.
